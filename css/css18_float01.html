    <p>Bayang Pilipinas</p>
    <p>The National Flag of the Philippines (Filipino: Pambansang Watawat ng Pilipinas) is a horizontal flag bicolor
         with equal bands of royal blue and crimson red, with a white, equilateral triangle at the hoist. In the center 
         of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each representing a Philippine province.[a] At each
          vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed, golden-yellow star, each of which representing one of the country's three 
          main island groups—Luzon, Visayas (though originally referring to Panay)[13] and Mindanao. The white triangle at the 
          flag represents liberty, equality, and fraternity. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of
           war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.[14]
